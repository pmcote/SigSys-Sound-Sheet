How to install the dependancies to run the sheet music generation on Abjad and Lilypond.

Install Lilypond 2.17 or greater from http://www.lilypond.org/download.html

Move it to your application directory.

Figure out how to add the lilypond executable to your .profile $PATH
(I can probably help with this, it depends on the shell you use)

Install Abjad following these instructions: http://abjad.mbrsi.org/start_here/installation/index.html

Fix your Abjad config
